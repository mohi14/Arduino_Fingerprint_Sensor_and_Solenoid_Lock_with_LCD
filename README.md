# üîê Arduino Fingerprint Sensor & Solenoid Lock with LCD

An Arduino-based biometric access control system using a fingerprint sensor, relay-driven solenoid lock, LCD display, LEDs, and buzzer.  
When a recognized fingerprint is presented, the solenoid is activated to unlock; otherwise the system denies access.

## üìå Overview & Features

- **Objective**: Use fingerprint authentication to control a solenoid lock via Arduino.  
- **Display**: I¬≤C LCD (1602) to show status messages. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Indicators**: Green LED (access granted), Red LED (access denied)  
- **Audio feedback**: Buzzer provides sound on access granted/denied  
- **Relay & Solenoid**: A relay module controls the solenoid lock on successful authentication  
- **Custom animations**: Stop sign and arrow animations shown on LCD for feedback  
- **Pin setup & connections**: Defined in the source sketch and explained below :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
